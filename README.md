# electron-prebuilt

This project has been merged into the
[electron/electron](https://github.com/electron/electron/tree/master/npm)
repository, and the `electron` module is now published to npm as part of the
Electron release process.

If you're having trouble installing or using Electron, please 
[file an issue on the electron/electron repo](https://github.com/electron/electron/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aissue%20is%3Aopen%20install%20).

## Backstory

In the early days of Electron, back when it was still called `atom-shell`, there 
was no module published to npm, nor was there even an Electron team at GitHub.
Electron was used primarly by the [Atom](https://atom.io/) team, and it was up 
to early adopters to manually download compiled binary builds of Electron for 
use in their apps.

In early 2015 [Max Ogden](https://github.com/maxogden) created 
[`electron-download`](https://github.com/electron-userland/electron-download) 
and `electron-prebuilt`, two npm modules to simplify the process of installing 
Electron. These tools quickly became de facto standards in the Electron 
community.

Shortly after `electron-prebuilt` was written, 
[John Muhl](https://github.com/johnmuhl/) created
[electron-prebuilt-updater](https://github.com/electron/electron-prebuilt-updater), 
a Heroku app to publish the the prebuilt module to npm automatically as new 
versions of Electron were published on GitHub.

Fast forward to mid-2017, and GitHub now has a team working full-time on 
Electron. We are working towards a more regular release cadence, 
and are incrementally documenting and [improving our release process](https://github.com/electron/electron/blob/master/docs/development/releasing.md). 
As we've added support for things like 
[TypeScript definitions](https://electron.atom.io/blog/2017/06/01/typescript),
it's been challening to work these additions into the `electron` -> `electron-prebuilt-updater` -> `electron-prebuilt` release flow.

To reduce the number of moving parts in the release process, we imported
the `electron-prebuilt` codebase into [`electron`](https://github.com/electron/electron/tree/master/npm) itself, and have 
[preserved the git history](https://github.com/electron/electron/pull/10172)
to acknowledge the contributions of the 32 open-source community members who 
have helped improve `electron-prebuilt` over the years.
